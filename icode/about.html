            <h2><Summary>About Spring holiday</Summary></h2>
            <p>Spring holiday, also known as spring break or March break, is a time when schools and universities typically have a week-long break in the spring semester. The exact dates of spring break vary depending on the institution, but it typically falls between late February and mid-April.

                Spring break is often associated with travel, particularly to warmer climates such as beaches or resorts, and is a popular time for college students to go on vacation. However, it is also a time for families to take a break and spend time together, whether it be through a vacation or simply enjoying time off at home.
                
                Many organizations and businesses also take advantage of the break by offering special programs, events, or discounts for students and families.
                
                It should be noted that spring break has become notorious for excessive partying and risky behavior, particularly among college students. As a result, many institutions have implemented stricter policies and safety measures during spring break to help ensure the well-being of their students.</p>

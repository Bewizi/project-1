        <p>The beginning of the day is vitally important to how the rest of your day is likely to go. If you donâ€™t want to get up on the wrong side of the bed, make it a habit to start your day off with a motivational quote or even more than one. It can help put you in the right frame of mind so that you have a much more positive day than you would've otherwise had. Everyone needs a little help to get the day started on a positive note, and there's nothing better to do this than a good cup of coffee and an inspirational and motivational quote.</p>

Help quiet your busy brain by using the generator to provide a motivational quote for you as you place your head on the pillow. Not only will you go to bed on a positive note, but the thoughts can also often carry through the night so that you wake up feeling positive as well.</p>

                The spot was perfect for camouflage. At least that's what she thought when she picked the spot. She couldn't imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings. So there she sat, confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger.

She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time.
